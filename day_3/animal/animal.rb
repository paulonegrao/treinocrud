#Build a class Animal that has two methods "eat" that prints "I'm eating" and a method "walk" that prints "I'm walking"
#Now build a class called Dog that inherits from the Animal class.
#Add a new method to this class called bark that returns woof.
#Override the eat methods and make it print whatever the Animal class eat method prints and then print "bones are yummy"
##Now build a class called Cat that inherits from the Animal class.
# Override the eat methods and make it print "I love Fish"
